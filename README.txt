This is the repository for *parcel*, a Python package to map the boundaries of properties from survey descriptions.

It currently contains three files other than this README:

- documentation for the package,
- a tutorial for the package, and
- a sample deed for use in the tutorial.

The tutorial is based on a working package which is not included in this repository.
