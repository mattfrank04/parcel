This is the repository for *parcel*, a Python package to map the boundaries of properties from survey descriptions.

It currently contains four files other than this README:

- documentation for the package,
- an example of using the package,
- a report generated from the package, and
- the sample deed used in the example.

The example is based on a working package which is not included in this repository.
